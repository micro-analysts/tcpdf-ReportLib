## 2.0.0 (2025-09-22)

Updated class namespaces to `MicroAnalysts\TcpdfReportLib` to represent the updated version. As this is a breaking change, the version has been bumped to 2, but not much has been changed so far.

As TCPDF will soon be deprecated as their new `tc-lib-pdf` is nearing completion, this fork is expected to eventually be replaced by a modernized option.
